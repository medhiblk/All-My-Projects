Overview
This project leverages various ensemble methods for predicting cancer using a dataset of medical records. The ensemble techniques implemented include Bagging with Random Forest, Boosting with AdaBoost, and Stacking with multiple base learners. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions by combining multiple models.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess medical records for model training.
Multiple Models: Implement Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Stacking classifiers.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Ensemble Learning: Combine the strengths of different models for better predictions.
Scalability: Easily adapt the models for larger datasets or different medical conditions.

Model Overview
Decision Tree
A simple model that splits the dataset into different branches to make decisions. It forms the baseline model for comparison with other ensemble methods.

Random Forest
An ensemble technique that uses multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

AdaBoost
A boosting technique that combines weak learners to form a strong classifier. It focuses more on the mistakes made by previous models.

Stacking
An advanced ensemble method that combines different models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Decision Tree) and uses a meta-learner (Logistic Regression) to improve prediction accuracy.

Architecture

The architecture follows a modular design with separate scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It allows for easy maintenance and scalability.
