<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

This project uses various ensemble methods to predict whether a patient has cancer based on medical data. It leverages models like Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Stacking to improve the prediction accuracy.

<!-- Features -->
### :dart: Features

- Data preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding, and scaling.
- Implementation of multiple models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Stacking.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- ## Ensemble Learning Techniques

### 1. Stacking
Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple models via a meta-classifier. Each base model is trained on the complete dataset, and the meta-model is trained on the outputs of these base models as features.

### 2. AdaBoost
AdaBoost is a boosting ensemble technique that sequentially trains models, with each focusing on correcting the errors of the previous ones.

### 3. Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

### 4. Bagging
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) involves training multiple models on different subsets of the data and then averaging their predictions for a more robust result.

<!-- Installation -->
## :gear: Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/medhiblk/All-My-Projects.git
    cd "All-My-Projects/Advanced ML-Cancer Prediction"
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

<!-- Usage -->
## :eyes: Usage

1. Place the `CancerPrediction.csv` file in the same directory as `Sklearn-CancerPrediction.py`.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python Sklearn-CancerPrediction.py
    ```
3. The script will preprocess the data, train the models, and display evaluation metrics.

<!-- Model Overview -->
## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Model Overview

### Decision Tree
A simple model that splits the dataset into different branches to make decisions. It serves as the baseline model.

### Random Forest
An ensemble method using multiple decision trees. It improves accuracy by averaging the predictions of several trees.

### AdaBoost
A boosting method that combines weak learners to create a strong classifier. Focuses on instances that previous models classified incorrectly.

### Stacking
An advanced ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Decision Tree) using a meta-learner (Logistic Regression) to enhance prediction accuracy.

<!-- Architecture -->
:house: Architecture
The project is built around a single Python script, Sklearn-CancerPrediction.py, which handles data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The script is designed to be modular, allowing for easy adaptation to other datasets or model types.
