# 🔍 Project Repository Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing two key projects developed during my coursework. These projects leverage Python and R to address distinct business challenges through data analysis. Below, you will find detailed descriptions of each project, focusing on their purpose, methodologies, and the insights they aim to provide.

## 📋 Project Descriptions

### 🗳️ 1. Donald Trump Communication Analysis on Twitter
#### 🎯 Objective:
This project aims to explore and analyze the communication strategies of Donald Trump on Twitter. By examining over 58,000 tweets from 2009 to November 19th, 2020, this analysis seeks to uncover patterns, trends, and sentiments in his social media interactions.

#### Methods Used:
- Apache Spark: Employed for processing large datasets efficiently.
- Sentiment Analysis: Determined the emotional tone behind a series of words, using lists of positive and negative words to assess the sentiments expressed in tweets.
- Trend Analysis: Evaluated how certain topics or keywords have trended over time to identify shifts in focus or strategy.
- Comparative Analysis: Distinguished between original tweets and retweets to understand the different communication approaches.

**Key Insights:**
- Sentiment trends over time.
- Most frequently used positive and negative words.
- Top hashtags and user mentions.
- Major themes and topics, including their evolution over time.
