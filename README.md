👋 Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio!
Hi everyone!

I'm excited to share my journey into the world of AI, Data Science, and Blockchain through this GitHub repository. With over 20 Data Science projects completed during my studies, where I achieved a grade of 17/20, I thought it would be valuable to showcase some of my favorite work here.

🚀 What You'll Find Here
For now, I've just started uploading a few projects, and I'll be continuously adding more as I clean up my code and provide detailed documentation. My goal is to build a comprehensive Data Science portfolio that reflects my skills and interests.

💡 About Me
I'm passionate about AI, Data Science, and Blockchain technology. Alongside my academic projects, I've explored various fun projects involving GPT and LLMs. For example, I developed a Python assistant using the Prophet library to analyze and forecast data, and even built a personalized health assistant that provides tailored meal plans, tracks calorie intake, and suggests vitamin supplements to avoid deficiencies.

In addition, I've ventured into creating a legal assistant trained on past laws, which has proven to be very efficient in supporting me with any legal questions.

🔍 What's Next?
I'll be expanding this GitHub repository, adding more projects and insights folder by folder. Each section will delve into different aspects of my work, including:

Generative AI: Projects showcasing my work with GPT models and LLMs.
Data Science in Finance: Applying AI to finance and corporate strategy.
Blockchain Explorations: My experiments and findings in the blockchain space.
Predictive Modeling: Including analyses like tweet predictions and health diagnostics.

🌟 Featured Projects
Health Coach Assistant: A personalized health tool that tracks your diet, suggests meals, and helps maintain a balanced nutrition.
Legal Assistant: A GPT-powered assistant that helps navigate complex legal questions.
Trump Tweet Prediction: An analysis of social media data to predict patterns in public discourse.

🎯 My Vision
This repository is not just a collection of code; it's a reflection of my dedication to learning and applying Data Science across various domains. I'll continue to enhance this portfolio, adding more detailed explanations and organized code.

Feel free to explore the repository and check out my LinkedIn for more insights into my professional journey. I’m passionate about startups and fintech, and I’m eager to share my findings on blockchain as I continue to learn. I'm still a newbie, but I'm committed to growing my knowledge and sharing what I learn here.

Let's connect—I'd love to know more about you!
